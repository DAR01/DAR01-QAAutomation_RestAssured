//String json: for ahrd coded 
//.json: file to be used if the content is static and fix, so there is no change to expect in the data
// pojo: the only parent class is java Object class. No other parent class
only getter and setter 
to be used when the data are dynamic and suggest to change

//lombok: reduce the code boiler plate as it is limit and save the creation of getter and setter

//Create a Pojo only for slightly simple json or pojo

//Never create a Pojo for complexe json better use: jsonpath query using athird party api like jayway for instance

//Never create a pojo for huge xml, better write xmlpath query with a thrid party api such as Jackson Dataformat XML » 2.19.0

Jackson Dataformat XML » 2.19.0 and jayway library use a query concept
